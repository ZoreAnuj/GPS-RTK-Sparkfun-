# Map Visualization with OpenCV and Google Static Maps API

This Python script provides real-time map visualization by reading GPS coordinates from a serial device and displaying them on a map fetched from the Google Static Maps API using OpenCV. The coordinates are plotted on the map, which updates dynamically as new data is received.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV-Python
- NumPy
- Requests
- PySerial

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy requests pyserial
